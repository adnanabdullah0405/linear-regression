# Income vs Score Prediction using Linear Regression 

##  Overview

This project implements a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict a person's score based on their income. It is an introductory machine learning project that demonstrates essential steps such as data visualization, preprocessing, training, and model evaluation.

This project is suitable for beginners aiming to understand how regression works in supervised learning scenarios using Python's `scikit-learn`.

##  Objective

To develop a predictive model that estimates a user’s score from their income using linear regression.

---

##  Dataset

- The dataset consists of two numerical variables:
  - `Income`: Annual income of the individual.
  - `Score`: Target variable, representing a numerical score (e.g., satisfaction, credit score, etc.)

*Note: You can replace this with real-world data or synthetic sample data.*

- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – data manipulation
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – model building and evaluation
